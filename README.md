## Description 
This web-application utilizes Machine learning to predict stock prices for the next week by teaching the machine through Scikit-Learn with historic prices.The application is deployed through AWS and the data is pulled both through an AWS stored MongoDB as well as FML Stock API.  

## User Story
```
Investing can be a daunting task for those who are new to the game.
I want to be able to predict a stocks price over the next week so that I know when is the best time to buy or sell.
A prediction based of historical data is not enough. I also want to see what the latest news on the company is and what is happening in the market through social media.
